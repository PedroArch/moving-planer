## Moving Planer

#### DESCRIPTION
A web application that, after the user enters the address, shows an image of the location in its background. And, with the help of APIS from the New York Times and Wikipedia, it brings information about the city and its latest news. For this program I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, as well as knowledge of the Google StreetView, New York Times and Wikipedia APIs.



#### RUNNING THE PROGRAM
